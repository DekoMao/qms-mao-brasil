    "cause": "Analysis:The problem occurred due to failure to meet the minimum aging time of the parts (48 hours) prior to shipment. This occurred because the production plan did not meet the adequate cooling time and there was no advance inspection based on Kanban. In addition, the parts were not available with the required aging time in stock, which resulted in moisture in the parts during the shipping process.\n\nRoot Cause: The root cause was the shipment of the parts without respecting the minimum inventory time of 48 hours, which is necessary to ensure adequate cooling of the parts prior to delivery.",

These actions were implemented to ensure that the parts met the aging requirements prior to shipment.\n\n\nLong Term Solution:  The long term solution involves implementing a continuous inspection system using Kanban to monitor curing time and ensure that all parts are inspected based on the appropriate cooling time. In addition, measures such as ventilation on the benches to cool the parts and removing excess moisture from the parts post-molding were taken to prevent similar issues in the future.",

The steam accumulator generated excess water, which was not properly removed, causing condensation on the parts. In addition, the LQC inspection did not detect internal moisture due to a superficial assessment, and the OQC inspector did not properly assess the parts, which resulted in the moisture being identified only after the parts were shipped to the customer.\nRoot Cause: The root cause of the problem was the failure to remove the moisture generated by the steam condensation. The lack of efficient containment for the condensate and the failure of the steam distribution system (steam accumulator) resulted in the excess moisture. In addition, the failure to inspect during the quality control process (LQC and OQC) prevented early detection of the problem.",

This involves re-evaluating and possibly revising the quality control processes, as well as taking steps to improve the moisture removal system in the molding process.",

In addition, the paint mixture with water was not adequately consolidated, which generated inconsistencies in production. These failures were not detected in time, which led to problems in the process.\nRoot Cause: \nThe root cause of the problem was the lack of adequate verification and control of the viscosity and color standard. Specifically:\nThe operator did not measure the paint viscosity before starting the production process.\nThe color standard was outside the desired parameters, but was adjusted without proper verification before production.\nThere was also a lack of procedure to wait for the paint to return to the bucket to ensure adequate mixing with the water.",

The problem was due to the lack of a standard in the ink sequencing and the delay in the contact of the cliché with the plate in the printing unit. In addition, there was no documented and followed procedure to define the sequencing of the colors in the printing units, which led to inadequate spacing of the colors.\n\nRoot Cause:The root cause was the lack of a standard ink sequencing pattern in the printing units. There was no clear and standardized procedure to determine the order of inks to be used in each printing unit (e.g.: 1st unit uses purple ink, 2nd uses orange ink, etc.), which resulted in variations in printing.",

The analysis demonstrated that the production process (injection molding) operated within approved parameters, ruling out machine and process issues as the cause. The problem is associated with the packaging used, which did not offer adequate geometric support for the part, combined with stacking, storage time, and environmental variations. Furthermore, there were no specific tests or inspections to assess post-transport deformations, preventing early detection of the nonconformity.\n\nRoot Cause: Systemic failure in the packaging definition, validation, and control process, due to non-compliance with the TUTIPLAST internal procedure (APQP – items 11.1 and 11.2), resulting in the use of non-validated packaging for storage and transport, which caused the warping of the back cover",
